   char * textdomain (const char *domainname)
   Function
  The textdomain function sets the default domain, which is used in all future gettext
calls, to domainname. Please note that dgettext and dcgettext calls are not influ-
enced if the domainname parameter of these functions is not the null pointer.
  Before the first call to textdomain the default domain is messages. This is the name
specified in the specification of the gettext API. This name is as good as any other
name. No program should ever really use a domain with this name since this can
only lead to problems.
  The function returns the value which is from now on taken as the default domain. If
the system went out of memory the returned value is NULL and the global variable
errno is set to ENOMEM. Despite the return value type being char * the return string
must not be changed. It is allocated internally by the textdomain function.
  If the domainname parameter is the null pointer no new default domain is set. Instead
the currently selected default domain is returned.
  If the domainname parameter is the empty string the default domain is reset to its
initial value, the domain with the name messages. This possibility is questionable to
use since the domain messages really never should be used.

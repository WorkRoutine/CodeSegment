 Different Between unsigned char and char

When you use a char to store a negtive value,
It will be difference from unsigned char. The range of
char is [-128, 128] and unsigned char is [255, 255].
If the highest bit is '1', and it will expand when change
another type. eg:
If a char vlaue is 0x80, and it turn into short type,
high bits will be set 1:
0x80 -> 0xFF80
If a unsigned char value is 0x80, and it turn into short type,
high bits will not be set 1:
0x80 -> 0x0080
If the highest bit is '0', and unsigned char is same with char.

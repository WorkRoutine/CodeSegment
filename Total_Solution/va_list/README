          ==== Parse variable argument ====

The library offer the function va_start(), va_end() and va_arg() to parse 
variable argument list.
The principle is argument list of function will push the stack when we 
call function, and argment store the stack from high address to low address.
So, the argument address of first argument is the highest for all arguments.
And, we only get the address of first argument and the type of variable 
argument,so we can calculate the address of next argument.
According this principle, the header file "stdarg.h" offer the macro to 
achive parse argument.

               ==== Different pinter loops a single list ====
  As usual, we use one-level pointer to loop some list.One-level pointer is 
easy to use, but some situation, we need 2-level pointer to loop list.
  2-level pointer base on one-level pointer, actually, they are same in some
situation.The value of 2-level pointer is a 1-level pointer and the address 
of 1-level pointer is a 2-level pointer,so we can use as follow:
   struct node {
      struct node *next;
   };

   struct node **pointer2;
   struct node *pointer1;

   struct node head = { .next = NULL};

   pointer1 = head.next;
   pointer2 = &pointer1;
   pointer1 = (*pointer2)->next;

So we can loop a single list with 1-level pointer is:

   for (pointer1 = head.next; pointer1; pointer1 = pointer1->next)
		;

And we can also loop a single list with 2-level pointer is:
   for (pointer2 = &head.next; *pointer2; pointer2 = &(*pointer2)->next)
		;
